# NMF Neural Nets

The NMF optimizer doesn't work well. But, the NMF would get well.


## Results of MNIST

Now it cannot run well. Please see [test_optimizers.py](https://github.com/ashigirl96/nmf-nn/blob/master/optimizer/tests/test_optimizers.py) or [mnist.py](https://github.com/ashigirl96/nmf-nn/blob/master/examples/mnist.py).

But now we can get accuracy 83% for only 7 iterations.

```python
NMF-optimizer
